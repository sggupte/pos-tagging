# Parts of Speech Tagging

The repo is broken down into two parts: one section for the discriminative model, and one for the generative model.

All code used to produce the results for the discriminative neural network are under the Discriminative folder.
There are three different scripts under this folder:

* torch_utils.py
* nn_training.py
*
