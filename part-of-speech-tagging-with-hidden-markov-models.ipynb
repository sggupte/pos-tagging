Project: Part of Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Models \n","---\n","#### This project is part of Natural Language Processing Nanodegree by Udacity \n","---\n","### Introduction\n","\n","Part of speech tagging is the process of determining the syntactic category of a word from the words in its surrounding context. It is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly with high accuracy. Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis (for example, _dis_-count as a noun vs dis-_count_ as a verb), for information retrieval, and for word sense disambiguation.\n","\n","In this notebook, you'll use the [Pomegranate](http://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a \"universal\" tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve [>96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~thorsten/publications/Brants-ANLP00.pdf). Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more. \n","\n","![_post-hmm.png](attachment:_post-hmm.png)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-10T19:35:13.050060Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-10T19:35:13.049370Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-10T19:35:13.056808Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-10T19:35:13.055105Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-10T19:35:13.050006Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":36,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-10T19:35:15.449112Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-10T19:35:15.448722Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-10T19:35:15.470629Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-10T19:35:15.469006Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-10T19:35:15.449077Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# import python modules -- this cell needs to be run again if you make changes to any of the files\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","import os\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import matplotlib.image as mplimg\n","import networkx as nx\n","import random\n","\n","from io import BytesIO\n","from itertools import chain\n","from collections import namedtuple, OrderedDict\n","\n","import nltk\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","Sentence = namedtuple(\"Sentence\", \"words tags\")\n","\n","\n","from IPython.core.display import HTML\n","from itertools import chain\n","from collections import Counter, defaultdict\n","from pomegranate import State, HiddenMarkovModel, DiscreteDistribution"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Step 1: Read and preprocess the dataset\n","---\n","We'll start by reading in a text corpus and splitting it into a training and testing dataset.

You should expect to get slightly higher accuracy using this simplified tagset than the same model would achieve on a larger tagset like the full [Penn treebank tagset](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html), but the process you'll follow would be the same.\n","\n","The `Dataset` class provided in helpers.py will read and parse the corpus.
